### Intro to Coding
#####About the Course
We designed Introduction to Coding for future Stormers like you, individuals with little or no programming experience, who are considering a career as a programmer. We mapped your experience as a sequence of four distinct Quests: Object-Oriented Programming, Programming in Java, Data Structures, and Relational Databases and SQL.

To achieve Stormer status, youâ€™ll need to conquer the Levels in each Quest by crushing the challenges set up for you by your instructor. Throughout, remember to:
  Be Urgent
  Be Precise
  Be Engaged
Each Quest will take you approximately 20-30 hours to complete. However, the time you spend on each topic and Quest will depend on your previous experience and understanding so actual completion times can vary widely.

Stormer Skills
Becoming a Stormer means acquiring the following abilities so that, by the end of the course, you are able to:
  Explain basic object-oriented programming fundamentals such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism
